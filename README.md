# DeepFake-Video-Detection
Repo for detecting deepfake and real videos.
This project aims to detect deep fake videos using a hybrid approach combining ResNeXt50 (a Convolutional Neural Network) for feature extraction and LSTM for sequence classification. The system is designed to process pre-processed datasets for accurate detection.


## Features

- Uses  ResNeXt50 for deep feature extraction from frames.
- Implements LSTM for sequential data classification.
- Pre-processed datasets available for quick experimentation.
- Supports evaluation with accuracy, precision, and F1-score metrics.
